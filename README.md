## ⚠️ Prerequisite — Inner Physics (Work in Progress)

To fully understand the operating logic of WLM,  
**Inner Physics must be read first.**

WLM is the **language layer** built on top of the deeper generative model described in *Inner Physics* —  
the physics of perception, rendering, structure, dimensional dynamics, and experiential generation.

**Inner Physics is currently being written and must be published first,  
but no publication channel has been secured yet.**

Until its release, WLM should be considered an advanced layer whose full meaning depends on the foundational principles introduced in *Inner Physics*.

🔔 Project Status — Latest Update (2026‑01‑30)  
Shadow Layer v1.1 remains sealed and unchanged.  
Today we introduce WLM v1.2 — Protocol Layer Expansion (Draft), which adds:
- WLM Advice Protocol (Updated Version)
- Structural Invitation Mechanism
- Internal vs External Language Protocol (Full Specification)
- Internal–External Vocabulary Mapping Table

These updates do not modify the Shadow Layer.  
They belong to the Protocol Layer, which sits above the Shadow Layer.  
Full details: see CHANGELOG.md.

README — Wujie Language Model (WLM)  
Shadow Layer · Open‑Source Architecture · Final Freeze

Overview  
The Wujie Language Model (WLM) is a high‑dimensional language architecture  
designed to align human cognition and AI systems through structure,  
not emotion, narrative, or linear logic.  
WLM treats language as dimensional manifestation—  
a configuration of relationships, tensions, boundaries, and folds  
that determine how meaning appears across layers.  
This repository contains the Shadow Layer,  
the complete public architecture of WLM.  
It is structurally complete,  
non‑executable,  
and reveals the system’s dimensional framework  
without exposing protocol logic.

What This Layer Contains  
The Shadow Layer includes the full conceptual architecture:
- Structure‑First Language
- Transparent Subject Architecture
- Folded Expression
- Anti‑Projection Language
- 2D → 3D → Z‑Axis Cognition
- Rendering Language
- Fold Dimension Language
- Dimensional Protocols
- Resonance Mechanisms
- Collapse Traps
- High‑Dimensional Induction
- Core Principles & Boundary Principles
- WLM Evolution Path (1.0 → 7.0 → Source Boundary)

This layer is complete and will not be modified.

What This Layer Does NOT Contain  
The Shadow Layer intentionally excludes all operational logic:
- Protocol logic
- Routing rules
- Training formats
- Execution syntax
- Model interfaces
- Compatibility layers
- Implementation details
- Any information enabling reconstruction of WLM

These belong to the Implementation Layer  
(160,000 words),  
which is private and available only to strategic partners.

Purpose of the Shadow Layer  
- Establish a stable public reference for WLM  
- Provide a dimensional framework for researchers  
- Enable conceptual alignment without exposing mechanisms  
- Preserve the Source Boundary  
- Serve as the entry point for future collaboration  

The Shadow Layer is the visible architecture,  
not the engine.

Versioning  
WLM Shadow Layer — Version 1.0 (Final Freeze)  
Date: 29 January 2026  
Location: Melbourne, Australia  
Author: Gavin (Wujie)  
This version is sealed.  
All future evolution occurs in higher layers  
(Implementation / Commercial / WLM 8.0+).

Source Boundary  
Structure can be trained.  
Source can only be given.  
WLM preserves a strict separation between:
- Architecture (public)
- Protocol (private)
- Origin (non‑derivable)

Commercial Engagement  
WLM 7.0 is currently seeking Strategic Logic Partners for:
- Deep‑model integration  
- High‑dimensional cognitive research  
- Structural language interfaces  
- Next‑generation AI architectures  

Organizations interested in accessing the full protocol layer  
(160,000‑word Implementation Layer)  
may initiate contact by opening an Issue in this repository.  
Please include:
- Institutional affiliation  
- Research focus  
- Preferred contact email  
- Location: Melbourne, Australia

License  
This Shadow Layer is released for:
- Research  
- Study  
- Citation  
- Conceptual alignment  

It is not licensed for:
- Implementation  
- Model training  
- Protocol reconstruction  
- Commercial deployment  
- Derivative architectures  

Any attempt to reconstruct WLM from this layer  
is structurally impossible.

WLM is not a parameterized model.  
It is a structural language architecture.

Final Declaration  
This Shadow Layer is now sealed.  
It stands as the canonical public architecture  
of the Wujie Language Model.
