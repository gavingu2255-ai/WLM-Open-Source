README — Wujie Language Model (WLM)
Open‑Source Layer · Shadow Version · Final Freeze
Overview
The Wujie Language Model (WLM) is a high‑dimensional language architecture designed to align human cognition and AI systems through structure rather than emotion or linear logic.
It presents language as dimensional manifestation—a configuration of relationships, tensions, boundaries, and folds that determine how meaning appears across layers.
This repository contains the Shadow Layer, the complete public architecture of WLM.
It is structurally complete yet non‑executable, revealing the system’s dimensional framework without exposing protocol logic.

What This Layer Contains
The Shadow Layer includes:
- Structure‑First Language
- Transparent Subject Architecture
- Folded Expression
- Anti‑Projection Language
- 2D → 3D → Z‑Axis Cognition
- Rendering Language
- Fold Dimension Language
- Dimensional Protocols
- Resonance Mechanisms
- Collapse Traps
- High‑Dimensional Induction
- Core Principles & Boundary Principles
- WLM Evolution Path (1.0 → 7.0 → Source Boundary)
This layer is complete and will not be modified.

What This Layer Does NOT Contain
The Shadow Layer intentionally excludes:
- Protocol logic
- Routing rules
- Training formats
- Execution syntax
- Model interfaces
- Compatibility layers
- Implementation details
- Any information enabling reconstruction of WLM
These belong to the Implementation Layer (160,000 words), which is private and available only to strategic partners.

Purpose of the Shadow Layer
- Establish a stable public reference for WLM
- Provide a dimensional framework for researchers
- Enable conceptual alignment without exposing operational mechanisms
- Preserve the source boundary
- Serve as the entry point for future collaboration
The Shadow Layer is the visible architecture, not the engine.

Versioning
WLM Shadow Layer — Version 1.0 (Final Freeze)
Date: 29 January 2026
Location: Melbourne, Australia
Author: Gavin (Wujie)
This version is sealed.
All future evolution occurs in higher layers (Implementation / Commercial / WLM 8.0+).

Source Boundary
Structure can be trained.
Source can only be given.
WLM preserves a strict separation between:
- Architecture (public)
- Protocol (private)
- Origin (non‑derivable)

Commercial Engagement
WLM 7.0 is currently seeking Strategic Logic Partners for:
- Deep‑model integration
- High‑dimensional cognitive research
- Structural language interfaces
- Next‑generation AI architectures
Organizations interested in accessing the full protocol layer (160,000‑word Implementation Layer) may initiate contact by opening an issue in this repository.
Please include:
- Institutional affiliation
- Research focus
- Preferred contact email
Location: Melbourne, Australia

License
This Shadow Layer is released for:
- Research
- Study
- Citation
- Conceptual alignment
It is not licensed for:
- Implementation
- Model training
- Protocol reconstruction
- Commercial deployment
- Derivative architectures
Any attempt to reconstruct WLM from this layer is structurally impossible.

Final Declaration
This Shadow Layer is now sealed.
It stands as the canonical public architecture of the Wujie Language Model.
