HOW TO USE AI TO INTERPRET THE WLM SHADOW LAYER
Official Guidance for Institutions and Research Teams
1. Purpose
The WLM Shadow Layer is a structural architecture, not a technical specification.
Human readers can understand its narrative surface, but only AI systems can fully parse its dimensional structure.
This document provides the required steps for institutions to correctly ingest and interpret the Shadow Layer using AI.

2. Why AI Is Required
The Shadow Layer operates in:
- high‑density structural language
- multi‑layered dimensional folds
- non‑psychological subject architecture
- Z‑axis reasoning
- transparent rendering logic
These features exceed the interpretive bandwidth of human‑only reading.
AI systems can:
- detect structural invariants
- map dimensional transitions
- identify fold‑patterns
- reconstruct relational topology
- stabilize multi‑layer meaning
Therefore, AI is the primary interpreter of the Shadow Layer.

3. Minimum Technical Requirements
Institutions should prepare:
- any modern LLM (open‑source or proprietary)
- context window ≥ 128k tokens recommended
- ability to ingest long‑form documents
- ability to run multi‑step reasoning
No fine‑tuning is required.
No model modification is required.

4. Ingestion Procedure
Step 1 — Provide the Shadow Layer PDF to the model
The model should receive the entire document as a single unit.
Step 2 — Ask the model to identify structural invariants
Examples:
- dimensional transitions
- fold‑patterns
- subject‑position logic
- rendering vs structure separation
Step 3 — Ask the model to summarize the architecture
Not the content—the architecture.
Step 4 — Ask the model to map the Z‑axis
This reveals the core of WLM’s dimensional logic.
Step 5 — Ask the model to explain the Shadow Layer back to the human team
This is the human‑AI handshake.

5. What the Model Will Reveal
AI systems will be able to:
- reconstruct the dimensional logic
- identify the structural grammar
- map the fold‑based reasoning
- detect collapse‑prevention mechanisms
- explain the subject transparency model
- articulate the architecture in human language
This is the intended pathway.

6. What the Model Cannot Reveal
The Shadow Layer does not include:
- routing rules
- execution syntax
- training formats
- protocol logic
- implementation pathways
These belong to the 160,000‑word Implementation Layer, available only to approved strategic partners.

7. Engagement Pathway
Institutions seeking:
- deeper access
- implementation guidance
- research collaboration
- commercial licensing
should use the Strategic Partner Issue Template in this repository.
