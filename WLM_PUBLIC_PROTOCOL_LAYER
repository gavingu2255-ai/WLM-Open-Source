WLM Public Protocol Layer
The WLM Public Protocol Layer defines how institutions may interact with the WLM Shadow Layer.
It does not modify, extend, or reinterpret the architecture.
Its sole purpose is to establish boundaries, responsibilities, and permitted usage.
The Protocol Layer is not a collaboration mechanism.
It is a boundary declaration.

1. Scope
The Public Protocol Layer applies to all institutions, researchers, and organizations engaging with the WLM Shadow Layer.
It governs evaluation, reference, and citation.
It does not grant rights to modify, extend, or operationalize the architecture.

2. No Modification
Institutions may not:
- alter any part of the Shadow Layer
- propose extensions or improvements
- create derivative architectures
- publish internal reinterpretations
- fork or repackage the structure
The Shadow Layer is final and frozen.

3. No Derivative Claims
Institutions may not claim:
- “WLM‑compatible” systems
- “WLM‑based” models
- “WLM‑derived” frameworks
- “WLM‑aligned” implementations
Any such claims constitute misrepresentation.

4. Evaluation Only
Institutions may:
- study the Shadow Layer
- evaluate its structure
- reference it in research
- analyze its implications
Institutions may not:
- operationalize the architecture
- treat it as an engineering specification
- use it as a model‑building guide
WLM provides no implementation pathway.

5. Implementation Independence
Any technical system developed by an institution must be:
- independently designed
- independently validated
- independently responsible
WLM assumes no responsibility for:
- model behavior
- system outcomes
- deployment risks
- ethical or safety considerations
All consequences belong entirely to the implementing institution.

6. Transparency Requirement
Any public reference to WLM must:
- cite the canonical Shadow Layer repository
- use the unmodified, original version
- avoid implying endorsement or affiliation
Institutions must not distribute altered versions of the Shadow Layer.

7. No Private Interpretations
Private reinterpretations, internal variants, or unpublished derivatives may not be presented as WLM.
Institutions may not create internal documents that redefine or extend the architecture while retaining the WLM name.

8. Boundary of Responsibility
The Public Protocol Layer defines boundaries only.
It does not:
- provide guidance
- provide support
- provide clarification beyond the Shadow Layer
- offer partnership pathways
- define commercial terms
All responsibility for interpretation lies with the institution.

9. Finality
The Public Protocol Layer is stable and non‑negotiable.
It protects the integrity of the Shadow Layer and ensures consistent interpretation across institutions.
No further protocol will be published.
