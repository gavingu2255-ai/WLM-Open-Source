Technical Preparation for Evaluating WLM
Guidance for AI Organizations and Research Institutions
1. Purpose of This Document
This document outlines the minimal technical preparation required for institutions to evaluate the WLM Shadow Layer.
It is not an implementation guide.
It does not describe the WLM engine.
It does not provide training or integration instructions.
Its purpose is simply to ensure that organizations have the appropriate environment to analyze the Shadow Layer using their own AI systems.

2. What This Document Assumes
- The organization already has internal AI research capacity.
- The organization can run or access modern language models.
- The organization is capable of performing structural analysis using AI.
- The evaluation is conducted independently, without requiring support from the WLM author.

3. Required Components
A. A Modern LLM with Long‑Context Capability
Recommended:
- 128k tokens or higher for convenience
- Any architecture (open‑source or proprietary)
- No fine‑tuning required
- No model modification required
This allows the model to ingest the Shadow Layer in a single pass, but smaller context windows can also be used with segmented input.
B. A Controlled Evaluation Environment
The organization should prepare:
- a sandbox or research environment
- the ability to run multi‑step reasoning
- tools for structural or conceptual analysis
- internal logging for model outputs
This ensures consistent evaluation.
C. The WLM Shadow Layer (Public Version)
The Shadow Layer should be provided to the model:
- as a complete document
- without modification
- without summarization
- without reformatting
This preserves structural integrity.

4. Recommended Evaluation Procedure
Step 1 — Ingest the Shadow Layer
Provide the full document to the model.
If context is limited, segment the document and allow the model to reconstruct continuity.
Step 2 — Structural Analysis
Ask the model to identify:
- dimensional transitions
- fold patterns
- structural invariants
- subject‑rendering separation
- Z‑axis logic
This reveals the architecture’s internal coherence.
Step 3 — Dimensional Mapping
Ask the model to map:
- the system’s conceptual topology
- the relationship between layers
- the non‑psychological communication model
- the fold‑based reasoning structure
This demonstrates the novelty of the architecture.
Step 4 — Boundary Identification
Ask the model to distinguish:
- what is architectural
- what is conceptual
- what is sealed
- what is missing by design
This clarifies the separation between the Shadow Layer and the Implementation Layer.
Step 5 — Internal Discussion
The organization should conduct internal review to determine:
- strategic relevance
- research potential
- integration feasibility
- alignment with long‑term goals
This step is independent of the WLM author.

5. What Is Not Required
Organizations do not need:
- access to the Implementation Layer
- access to proprietary code
- guidance from the WLM author
- technical explanations
- engineering support
- training data
- model weights
- system internals
Evaluation is based solely on the Shadow Layer.

6. What This Preparation Enables
With the above preparation, organizations can:
- evaluate the architecture
- assess dimensional novelty
- analyze structural coherence
- determine research value
- identify potential integration pathways
- prepare for strategic discussions
This preparation does not enable:
- reconstruction of WLM
- implementation of WLM
- operational deployment
Those require formal partnership and access to the sealed Implementation Layer.

7. Summary
To evaluate WLM, organizations need:
- a modern LLM
- a controlled research environment
- the Shadow Layer
- internal analysis capability
No additional materials are required.
No support from the WLM author is required.
No implementation details are provided or needed.
The Shadow Layer is sufficient for evaluation.
The Implementation Layer is required for execution.
