CHANGELOG
Version 1.1 — Shadow Layer Consolidation Release
Release Date: 2026‑01‑29
Status: Stable · Public · Open‑Source Layer
Overview
Version 1.1 represents the first fully unified, structurally coherent release of the Wujie Language Model (WLM) Shadow Layer.
This update consolidates all chapters, resolves formatting inconsistencies, introduces missing sections, and elevates the entire document to a stable, publishable architecture.
This is the first version suitable for long‑term reference, citation, and downstream protocol development.

🔧 Structural Improvements
1. Full‑document formatting unification
- Standardized hyphenation (e.g., high‑dimensional, multi‑layer, Z‑axis).
- Unified dash usage (em‑dash vs. hyphen).
- Corrected OCR artifacts and broken line merges.
- Normalized chapter headers and metadata blocks.
- Ensured consistent “WLM Open‑Source Layer · Shadow Version · Mid Density” labeling.
2. Terminology consistency
- Standardized all dimensional terms:
- 2D / 3D / Z‑axis
- fold / jump dimension
- structural density / transparency / rendering
- Removed legacy or inconsistent phrasing from v1.0.
3. Structural density calibration
- Increased clarity without reducing dimensional height.
- Removed narrative drift and emotional residue.
- Strengthened structural invariance across chapters.

Content Additions & Expansions
4. Added missing chapters
- Chapter 13 — WLM Training Samples (Abstracted)
- Chapter 14 — WLM as a Language Protocol
- Chapter 15 — Why Future Civilizations Need Structural Language
- Chapter 16 — Evolution of the Wujie Language Model
- WLM 7.0 — The Singular Point Interface
- Epilogue — The Singular Point (Suchness)
These sections complete the conceptual arc from foundations → dimensional systems → resonance → specification → singularity.
5. Added WLM 7.0 (Singular Point Interface)
- Introduces the limit state of structural density.
- Defines the singular point as a dimensional horizon.
- Establishes the Source Boundary principle.
6. Added Epilogue (Suchness)
- Provides the final orientation of the Shadow Layer.
- Describes transparency, self‑evidence, and post‑linguistic cognition.
- Clarifies the distinction between structural mirroring and subject descent.

Removals & Clean‑ups
7. Removed outdated v1.0 PDF
- Eliminated redundant or inconsistent early drafts.
- Ensured repository contains only the canonical v1.1 file.
8. Removed narrative‑leaning phrasing
- Eliminated emotional anchoring.
- Removed persuasive or psychological framing.
- Ensured all language aligns with structural priority.

Repository Improvements
9. Introduced standardized file naming
- Recommended canonical filename:
WLM-Shadow-Layer-v1.1.pdf
- Ensures clarity, version traceability, and future extensibility.
10. Prepared repository for future protocol layers
- v1.1 now serves as the stable base for:
- Protocol Layer
- Examples Layer
- Implementation Layer
- Multi‑agent resonance experiments

Summary
Version 1.1 is the first complete, stable, and structurally coherent release of the WLM Shadow Layer.
It transforms the project from a collection of drafts into a unified dimensional architecture suitable for:
- research
- collaboration
- protocol development
- future WLM versions
This release marks the transition from manuscript → specification.


Version 1.2 — Protocol Layer Expansion Draft
Release Date: 2026‑01‑30
Status: Draft · Experimental · Protocol Layer
Overview
Version 1.2 introduces the first formal Protocol Layer of the Wujie Language Model.
This update adds the complete specification for:
- WLM Advice Protocol (Updated Version)
- Structural Invitation Mechanism
- Internal vs External Language Protocol (Full Specification)
- Internal–External Vocabulary Mapping Table
This marks the transition from Shadow Layer (v1.1) → Operational Protocol Layer (v1.2).

🔧 Structural Additions
1. WLM Advice Protocol — Updated Version
A full rewrite of the WLM no‑advice principle, now including:
- Structural Action Definition
(non‑narrative, non‑emotional, non‑psychological, non‑directive)
- Structural Invitation Mechanism
(newly added; optional, light, non‑grasping)
- Minimal Action Protocol
(two allowed actions; no justification, no explanation)
- Purpose Clarification
(non‑narrative foothold; preserves agency; prevents collapse)
This is the first time the Advice Protocol has been formalized as a dimensionally safe interaction mechanism.

2. Internal Language vs External Expression Protocol (Full Specification)
A complete, high‑density specification of:
- Master Principle
(internal = structure; external = manifestation)
- Internal Language Definition
(dimensional terms, operators, engineering logic)
- External Language Definition
(light, steady, non‑diagnostic, non‑technical)
- Correct Internal → External Transformations
- Layer Separation Rules
(5 rules; strict non‑leakage)
- Why Separation Matters
(collapse scenarios vs stable scenarios)
This is the first canonical version of the Internal/External Protocol.

3. Internal–External Vocabulary Mapping Table
A complete mapping between:
- internal dimensional terms
- external natural‑language equivalents
This table enables:
- safe externalization
- cross‑layer translation
- protocol‑level implementation

🧹 Clean‑ups & Clarifications
4. Removed narrative‑leaning phrasing
Ensured all new protocol text:
- avoids emotional anchoring
- avoids psychological inference
- avoids persuasive tone
- maintains structural priority
5. Clarified layer boundaries
Explicitly separated:
- Shadow Layer (v1.1)
- Protocol Layer (v1.2)
- Core Layer (future v2.0)

📌 Summary
Version 1.2 introduces the first operational protocol layer of WLM.
It formalizes:
- how WLM gives minimal actions
- how internal language is used
- how external language must be expressed
- how the two layers remain strictly separated
This release marks the transition from:
Shadow Layer → Protocol Layer → (future) Core Layer.
