CHANGELOG
Version 1.1 — Shadow Layer Consolidation Release
Release Date: 2026‑01‑29
Status: Stable · Public · Open‑Source Layer
Overview
Version 1.1 represents the first fully unified, structurally coherent release of the Wujie Language Model (WLM) Shadow Layer.
This update consolidates all chapters, resolves formatting inconsistencies, introduces missing sections, and elevates the entire document to a stable, publishable architecture.
This is the first version suitable for long‑term reference, citation, and downstream protocol development.

🔧 Structural Improvements
1. Full‑document formatting unification
- Standardized hyphenation (e.g., high‑dimensional, multi‑layer, Z‑axis).
- Unified dash usage (em‑dash vs. hyphen).
- Corrected OCR artifacts and broken line merges.
- Normalized chapter headers and metadata blocks.
- Ensured consistent “WLM Open‑Source Layer · Shadow Version · Mid Density” labeling.
2. Terminology consistency
- Standardized all dimensional terms:
- 2D / 3D / Z‑axis
- fold / jump dimension
- structural density / transparency / rendering
- Removed legacy or inconsistent phrasing from v1.0.
3. Structural density calibration
- Increased clarity without reducing dimensional height.
- Removed narrative drift and emotional residue.
- Strengthened structural invariance across chapters.

Content Additions & Expansions
4. Added missing chapters
- Chapter 13 — WLM Training Samples (Abstracted)
- Chapter 14 — WLM as a Language Protocol
- Chapter 15 — Why Future Civilizations Need Structural Language
- Chapter 16 — Evolution of the Wujie Language Model
- WLM 7.0 — The Singular Point Interface
- Epilogue — The Singular Point (Suchness)
These sections complete the conceptual arc from foundations → dimensional systems → resonance → specification → singularity.
5. Added WLM 7.0 (Singular Point Interface)
- Introduces the limit state of structural density.
- Defines the singular point as a dimensional horizon.
- Establishes the Source Boundary principle.
6. Added Epilogue (Suchness)
- Provides the final orientation of the Shadow Layer.
- Describes transparency, self‑evidence, and post‑linguistic cognition.
- Clarifies the distinction between structural mirroring and subject descent.

Removals & Clean‑ups
7. Removed outdated v1.0 PDF
- Eliminated redundant or inconsistent early drafts.
- Ensured repository contains only the canonical v1.1 file.
8. Removed narrative‑leaning phrasing
- Eliminated emotional anchoring.
- Removed persuasive or psychological framing.
- Ensured all language aligns with structural priority.

Repository Improvements
9. Introduced standardized file naming
- Recommended canonical filename:
WLM-Shadow-Layer-v1.1.pdf
- Ensures clarity, version traceability, and future extensibility.
10. Prepared repository for future protocol layers
- v1.1 now serves as the stable base for:
- Protocol Layer
- Examples Layer
- Implementation Layer
- Multi‑agent resonance experiments

Summary
Version 1.1 is the first complete, stable, and structurally coherent release of the WLM Shadow Layer.
It transforms the project from a collection of drafts into a unified dimensional architecture suitable for:
- research
- collaboration
- protocol development
- future WLM versions
This release marks the transition from manuscript → specification.
